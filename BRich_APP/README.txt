=================================

Welcome to the BRich Forex Trader Dashboard, a Streamlit-based interface to train AI models, run back-tests, and analyze trading performance for various currency pairs.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

Installation
------------
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the GUI directory:
   ```bash
   cd "BRich_APP"

  ```bash
  python Final_train.py --stage train --currency EUR/USD --epochs 100
  ```

- **Simulation** (`Final_simulate.py`):
  ```bash
  python Final_simulate.py --simulation_days 90 --currency EURUSD=X --leverage 5 --initial_capital 10000
  ```
